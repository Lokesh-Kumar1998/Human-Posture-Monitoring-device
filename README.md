The last two decades have witnessed an exponential growth and tremendous developments
in wireless technologies and systems, and their associated applications.Posture is the way
people carry themselves, in the way they stand, sit, walk and perform tasks, and this
posture has a substantial effect on their health. Maintaining a good posture allows the
vertebras of the spine to be correctly aligned. Poor posture has been linked with bad health
as well as lower performance. A study showed that having a slouched posture impacts the
transverses abdominis muscle. It was shown that the thickness of the transverses abdominis
muscle is significantly less when a person maintained a slouched posture. This transversus
abdominis dysfunction is directly associated with low back pain. Low back pain is one of
the leading cause of disability in the world, where it is estimated that around 80% of the
world population will experience it at some point in their lives. Each year in the United
States, around 50 billion dollars is spent on treating back pain. This problem can also be
seen in the UAE where 62% of the young population report to suffer from back pain. Dr.
Hilali Noordeen, an orthopedic surgeon at Burjeel Hospital in the UAE said that back pain
caused by daily habits such as sitting on a chair with a hunchback, can have severe
damaging effects in the long run. Moreover, another study showed that subjects asked to sit
with a hunched posture, reported greater stress and thus lower performance. Maintaining
the same position for a long time, even with good posture, is also considered a bad postural
habit as the muscles in the spine may stop producing substances that are essential for
normal biological operations. Therefore, keeping a good posture and changing oneâ€™s
position from time to time is considered important, if not necessary for maintain good health.
